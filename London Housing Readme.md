**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of London Housing Data**

**Project Overview**

This project involves performing an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python in a Jupyter Notebook to analyze housing data in London. The analysis aims to uncover key insights into housing trends, price fluctuations, and the factors influencing property values across different boroughs of London. The findings will support real estate professionals, investors, and policymakers in making informed decisions related to the housing market.

**Objective**

The primary objectives of this project are:

1. **Price Trend Analysis:** Investigate the trends in housing prices over time across various boroughs in London.
1. **Borough Comparison:** Compare property values and price changes across different boroughs to identify high-demand areas.
1. **Influencing Factors:** Analyze the factors influencing housing prices, such as property type, location, and proximity to amenities.
1. **Sales Volume Analysis:** Examine the volume of property sales over time to understand market activity and demand.
1. **Affordability Assessment:** Assess the affordability of housing in different boroughs, considering median incomes and price-to-income ratios.

**Data Source**

The dataset used for this analysis includes comprehensive records of housing transactions in London, with key fields such as:

- **Transaction Details:** Date of sale, property price, and transaction type (e.g., freehold, leasehold).
- **Property Information:** Details on property types (e.g., flat, house), number of rooms, and square footage.
- **Location Data:** Borough, postcode, and geographical coordinates of properties.
- **Economic Indicators:** Median income levels, employment rates, and other socio-economic factors by borough.
- **Time Series Data:** Monthly or quarterly housing price indices and transaction volumes.

**Key Analysis Techniques**

- **Data Cleaning and Preparation:**
  - Handling missing values, outlier detection, and data normalization to ensure the accuracy of the analysis.
- **Descriptive Statistics:**
  - Calculation of measures such as mean, median, and standard deviation to summarize housing prices and sales data.
- **Visualizations:**
  - Use of bar charts, line graphs, heatmaps, and scatter plots to visualize trends and patterns in the housing market.
- **Correlation Analysis:**
  - Identifying relationships between housing prices and factors such as location, property type, and economic indicators.
- **Geospatial Analysis:**
  - Mapping property prices across different boroughs to identify spatial patterns and hotspots.
- **Time Series Analysis:**
  - Analyzing price trends over time to identify periods of significant change and predict future price movements.

**Tools and Libraries**

- **Python:** The primary programming language used for data analysis.
- **Jupyter Notebook:** The development environment used to write and document the code.
- **Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy:** For numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** For data visualization.
- **Plotly:** For interactive visualizations.
- **Geopandas:** For geographical plotting and spatial analysis.
- **Statsmodels:** For time series analysis and forecasting.

**Conclusion**

This project provides a comprehensive exploratory analysis of the London housing market, offering valuable insights into price trends, market dynamics, and factors influencing property values. The results of this analysis can guide real estate strategies, investment decisions, and housing policy development in London.
